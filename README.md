this repo is my first test using this tool. Honestly I don't think I've heard of this tool before. Or perhaps, I have seen it, that is, I've seen other's peoples repositories but never really understood what was I looking at. Therefore, now, that I sort of can do something in this mark down file, let me copy a poem:

<h1> Um Adeus Português, Alexandre O' Neill</h1>

<em>or</em>

## Un Adiós Portugés, Alexandre O' Neill

<em>or</em>

<h2>A Portuguese Farawell </h2>

>   Não tu não podias ficar presa comigo 
    à roda em que apodreço 
    apodrecemos

<em>or</em>


<p>No tu no podias estar atrapada conmigo<br>
<p> en la rueda en que me <strong>pudro</strong><br>
<p><strong>nos pudrimos</strong></p>

<em>or</em>

<p>No you <strong>couldn't</strong> be stuck with me</p>
<p>to the wheel in which I rot</p>
<p>we rot</p>

<p><strong>bolded words are for consideration</strong></p>

<p>listen to the poem here:<br>

<p>and here is just one of the videos that I desperately needed to do this copy this poem with this tool:<br>

# Conclusion

<p>Alexandre O'Neill lived the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal. The <em>Irish Time</em> explains the context of his poetry:
>  
    "He lived through the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal and that is the background to a lot of his poetry, so much of it is fuelled by anger," he says. Some of this emanated from O'Neill's love of a French girl, Nora Mitrani. When she left Portugal (she later committed suicide) the regime refused him a passport to follow her, a predicament that forms the background to one of his most famous poems, 'Um Adeus Português' (A Portuguese Farewell')"
