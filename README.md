# maraitragonatest1
this repo is my first test using this tool. Honestly I don't think I've heard of this tool before. Or perhaps, I have seen it, that is, I've seen other's peoples repositories but never really understood what was I looking at. Therefore, now, that I sort of can do something in this mark down file, let me copy a poem:


## Um Adeus Português, Alexandre O' Neill
<p>or</p>

<h1>
Un Adiós Portugés, Alexandre O' Neill
</h1>

or 
<h2>
A Portuguese Farawell --?--
</h2>

>
<p>
Não tu não podias ficar presa comigo
à roda em que apodreço
apodrecemos
</p>

>><h1>or</h1>
<p>No tu no podias estar atrapada conmigo
en la rueda en que me <strong>pudro</strong>
<strong>nos pudrimos</strong></p>>>

<h2>or</h2>
<p>No you <strong>couldn't</strong> be stuck with me 
to the wheel in which I rot 
we rot</p>

<p><strong>bolded words for consideration</strong></p>

<p>listen to the poem here: (https://soundcloud.com/allan-kenayt/um-adeus-portugues-alexandre-oneill)</p>

<p>and here are the videos that I desperately need to do this:

<p>Alexandre O'Neill lived the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal. The Irish Time explains the context of his poetry:
<"He lived through the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal and that is the background to a lot of his poetry, so much of it is fuelled by anger," he says. Some of this emanated from O'Neill's love of a French girl, Nora Mitrani. When she left Portugal (she later committed suicide) the regime refused him a passport to follow her, a predicament that forms the background to one of his most famous poems, 'Um Adeus Português' (A Portuguese Farewell')>
